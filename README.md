# Movie Trailers

## Description of the project

[Project](https://github.com/EdoardoGruppi/Movie_Trailers) ~ [Website](https://edoardogruppi.github.io/Movie_Trailers/#/)

**Movie Trailers** is a website that allows users to search films or tv series by title, genre as well as cast. Specifically, by clicking on the poster related to the desired content, the app provides its trailer and other useful information. The project, which is developed basing the design on the official Netflix App, is realised using JavaScript, ReactJS and CSS.

The website can be accessed at the following link: https://edoardogruppi.github.io/Movie_Trailers.

## Notes

The films without posters are not considered. Nevertheless, it is possible to include them by directly modifying the code. In particular, the first line of the getUniqueObjects in ./src/Helpers/SearchUtilities.js should be commented.
